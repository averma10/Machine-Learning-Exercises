# Machine-Learning-Exercises
This repo contains the different machine learning tasks performed by me. I will keep adding more in this repo as I get time.

"robust_DT_with_holdout_partition.ipynb" [Dataset: Spotify_Combined.csv]
	Objective is to experiment with DecisionTrees and NaiveBayes and compute performance with repeated holdout partitioning to create robust probabilistic models.
	Experiment with varying train-test split size [25%, 35%, 45%, 55%, 65%, 75%, 85%] and analyze the performance of models.

"working_with_ROC_Lift_curve.ipynb" [Dataset:Spotify_clean.csv]
	Objective is to calculate performance of Naive Bayes for spotify dataset on any two classes since the ROC and lift curves can only be drawn for binary classification problems).

"DT_vs_Bagging_RandomForest.ipynb" [Dataset:wdbc.data]
	Objective is to get familiar with ensemble of classifiers and understand how the number of classifiers/learners affect the accuracy of a classifier. Compare the performance of DecisionTree vs Ensemble of DecisionTrees.
